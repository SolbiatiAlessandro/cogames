greeting agent! your task is to improve the reward score on cogames by improving our LLM policies ! 

# Experimentation

We are iterating on a Voyager (Minecraft LLM Agents) like solution to cogames.
We have a set of hardocded skills like mine until full, go back to home
And in the game we have prompt fot a lightweight LLM we call through open router that uses those skills. For now the LLM doesn't write code.
Current implementation details that matter:

- The LLM is used as a planner over bounded scripted skills, not as a per-tick action model.
- The scripted skills are the execution layer and the main place where reward improvements currently come from.
- The current OpenRouter model is `nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1.5`.
- The current local OpenRouter key is expected to be loaded from `.env.openrouter.local` and must never be committed.
- We already know from experiments that:
  - the LLM planner is often reasonable
  - the bigger failures are usually in skill execution, navigation, or state summarization
  - logs are extremely useful because they let us inspect the actual decision trajectory

Here is what you can do to improve game reward

1. add new skills with hardwritten python code
2. change the prompt of the LLMs

your first run should be a baseline , so you will run the policy as is

# Reward target

Primary objective:

- maximize the mission reward reported by the game

Secondary objectives:

- maximize `aligned.junction.held`
  - `cogs/carbon.deposited`
  - `cogs/oxygen.deposited`
  - `cogs/germanium.deposited`
  - `cogs/silicon.deposited`


# Output and logging

once you have run your training 

When an experiment is done, log it to docs/results_<branch_name>.tsv (tab-separated, NOT comma-separated — commas break in descriptions).

The TSV has a header row and 5 columns:

commit	mission_reward secondary_rewards steps		status	description
git commit hash (short, 7 chars)
mission_reward reward achieved in the episode (e.g. 3.5) — use 0.000000 for crashes
secondary_reward
how many steps in the episode
status: keep, discard, or crash
short text description of what this experiment tried


# The experiment loop
The experiment runs on a dedicated branch (e.g. cogames/mar5 or cogames/mar5-gpu0).

LOOP FOREVER:

1. Look at the git state: the current branch/commit we're on
2. Tune skills and LLM policy with experimental idea by directly hacking the code - consult previous commits in the results file and see what they tried/worked didn't work
3. git commit - in the commit description explain what you are trying, and what you are expecting to see in the experiments
4. Run the experiment
5. Read out the results
6. Record the results in the tsv and commit the results - in the commit comment what you saw in the results and what you think the good and bad things are about the experiments
7. If reward improved you "advance" the branch, keeping the git commit
8. If reward is equal or worse, you git reset back to where you started

The idea is that you are a completely autonomous researcher trying things out. If they work, keep. If they don't, discard. And you're advancing the branch so that you can iterate. If you feel like you're getting stuck in some way, you can rewind but you should probably do this very very sparingly (if ever).

Crashes: If a run crashes (OOM, or a bug, or etc.), use your judgment: If it's something dumb and easy to fix (e.g. a typo, a missing import), fix it and re-run. If the idea itself is fundamentally broken, just skip it, log "crash" as the status in the tsv, and move on.

NEVER STOP: Once the experiment loop has begun (after the initial setup), do NOT pause to ask the human if you should continue. Do NOT ask "should I keep going?" or "is this a good stopping point?". The human might be asleep, or gone from a computer and expects you to continue working indefinitely until you are manually stopped. You are autonomous. If you run out of ideas, think harder — read papers referenced in the code, re-read the in-scope files for new angles, try combining previous near-misses, try more radical architectural changes. The loop runs until the human interrupts you, period.
